;;; Commentary:

;; smart-forward gives you semantic navigation, building on
;; [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el). It is most easily
;; explained by example:

;;    function test() {
;;      return "semantic navigation";
;;    }

;; With point at the start of the quotes,

;;  * `smart-forward` would go to the end of the quotes
;;  * `smart-backward` would go to the start of `return`, then to the `{`.
;;  * `smart-up` would go to the `{`
;;  * `smart-down` would go to the `}`

;; I use M-up/down/left/right arrows for this.

;; ## Installation

;; Start by installing
;; [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el).

;;     (require 'smart-forward)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-<up>") 'smart-up)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-<down>") 'smart-down)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-<left>") 'smart-backward)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-<right>") 'smart-forward)

;; ## Contribute

;; smart-forward is a thin wrapper around expand-region. Most fixes to
;; smart-forward belong there.

;;; Code:

(require 'expand-region)

(defun smart--name-contains-inside-p (f)

;; er mange expansions som matcher word ... method-call, for eksempel
;; m√• heller expande videre dersom det som er selecta matcher en word-regexp
